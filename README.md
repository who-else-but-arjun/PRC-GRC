# RL Trading System - Complete Guide

## Quick Start 
### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install numpy pandas gymnasium stable-baselines3 torch tqdm matplotlib
```

### Prepare Data
Place your raw tick data CSV files in a folder (e.g., `EBX/`):
```
EBX/
├── day1.csv
├── day2.csv
└── day3.csv
```

## Commands Explained

### Command 1: `python script.py train EBX`

**What Happens:**

1. **Data Resampling** (2-3 mins)
   - Reads tick data from `EBX/` folder
   - Converts to 2-minute OHLC candles
   - Saves to `EBX_2min/` (skips if already exists)
   - Creates `train_days_EBX.txt` and `test_days_EBX.txt`

2. **Indicator Calculation** (1 min)
   - Precomputes 60+ technical indicators for ALL training days
   - Applies 30-minute warmup window (discards first 30 mins of each day)
   - Stores in memory (~10MB per day)

3. **Model Training** (5-10 mins depending on CPU/GPU)
   - Launches parallel environments (CPU cores - 2)
   - Trains PPO model for 600,000 timesteps
   - Prints training progress with tqdm bar
   - Monitors: entropy loss, explained variance, policy loss
   - GPU auto-detects and uses if available

4. **Model Saving** 
   - Saves trained model: `Models_EBX/ppo_trading_model_EBX.zip`
   - Saves normalization stats: `Models_EBX/ppo_trading_model_EBX_vecnormalize.pkl`
   - Generates training plots: `training_plots/EBX_training_metrics.png`
   - Generates feature info: `feature_info_EBX.txt`

### Command 2: `python script.py test EBX`

**What Happens:**

1. **Model Loading** 
   - Loads trained model from `Models_EBX/ppo_trading_model_EBX.zip`
   - Loads normalization stats from `Models_EBX/ppo_trading_model_EBX_vecnormalize.pkl`
   - Verifies both files exist

2. **Per-Day Backtesting** (2-5 mins per day, depends on test days count)
   - For each test day:
     - Loads 2-min candle data
     - Calculates indicators (with 30-min warmup)
     - Runs model forward with `deterministic=True`
     - Records every trade entry/exit with price and timestamp
     - Calculates daily P&L in basis points (bps)
     - Generates signals (BUY, SELL, EXIT)

3. **Trade Analysis** 
   - Calculates per-trade PnL
   - Counts winning/losing trades
   - Computes win rate
   - Tracks highest/lowest prices for trailing stops

4. **Output Generation** 
   - Saves all signals to CSV: `signals_EBX/day123.csv`
   - Generates price charts: `test_trade_plots/EBX_day_1_day123.png`
   - Calculates equity curve and drawdown
   - Saves equity plot: `test_results/EBX_equity_drawdown.png`
   - Writes report: `test_results/test_results_EBX.txt`
   - **Prints to console:** Trade log with timestamps, prices, positions

**Expected Bugs & Solutions:**

| Bug | Cause | Solution |
|-----|-------|----------|
| "VecNormalize file not found" | Didn't run train command first | Run `python script.py train EBX` first |
| All trades losing | Model overtrained on train set (overfitting) | Train on more diverse data or reduce training episodes |
| 0 trades executed | Model learned to always hold | Increase `TRADE_ENTRY_PENALTY` (currently -5) or check reward scaling |

---

### Command 3: `python script.py test EBX day123`

**What Happens:**

1. **Specific Day Filtering** (1 sec)
   - Searches for `day123` in test file list
   - Only tests that single day (not all test days)
   - Useful for debugging specific days

---

### Command 4: `python script.py backtest_ebullient EBX`

**What Happens:**

1. **Backtest Execution** (5-30 mins depending on days and trades)
   - Initializes BacktesterIIT with config
   - Runs Ebullient's market simulator
   - For each signal:
     - EXIT signal → Closes position
     - BUY signal → Opens long (100 shares)
     - SELL signal → Opens short (100 shares)
   - Prints backtest results

**Expected Bugs & Solutions:**

| Bug | Cause | Solution |
|-----|-------|----------|
| "day(\d+)" regex error | Signal file naming doesn't match pattern | Check files are named like `day1.csv`, `day2.csv` (not `day_1.csv`) |
| Config file error | JSON formatting issue | Manually inspect `config.json` created in root |

## Common Issues & Global Solutions

### Issue 1: "PARAMS mismatch between training and testing"
**Problem:** You changed stop loss/trailing stop but didn't retrain
**Solution:** 
- Training uses `STOP_LOSS_TR`, `TRAIL_PCT_TR`
- Testing uses `STOP_LOSS_TE`, `TRAIL_PCT_TE` (can be different!)
- Model learns exits based on TRAINING params
- Testing params determine what exits are ENFORCED during test
- If you change testing params, results will differ (but model hasn't relearned)

### Issue 2: "Too many/too few trades"
**Problem:** Model behavior doesn't match expectations
**Solutions:**
- Too many: Increase `TRADE_ENTRY_PENALTY` (currently -5) to -10 or -15
- Too few: Decrease `TRADE_ENTRY_PENALTY` to 0 or -2
- Too many stops: Decrease `STOP_LOSS` from -0.0004 to -0.0002
- Retrain after changing parameters
